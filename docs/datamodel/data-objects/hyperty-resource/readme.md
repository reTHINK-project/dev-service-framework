### Hyperty Resource

![Hyperty Resource Data Object Model](Hyperty-Resource-Data-Object-Model.png)

The Hyperty Resource Data Model is used by the Communication Data Model to model Resources shared in reTHINK Communications e.g. user audio, user video, files, chat messages, etc.

The Hyperty Resource Data Model is also used by the Context Data Model to model Resources (e.g. physical measurements and objects) associated to Context Values published by reTHINK Context producers e.g. light, human heart rate, humidity, etc.

This model should be compliant with W3C MediaStream API.
