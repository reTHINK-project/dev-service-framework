An analysis on how to apply the Reporter-Observer pattern on communication setup is performed below.



### Connection setup start

Alice creates Connection object as well as its LocalConnectionDescription and LocalICECandidates Objects and reports to Bob.

Bob receives Alice request, creating Connection object and its RemoteConnectionDescriptions and RemoteICECandidates objects sent by Alice. Bob is set as observer of these objects.

As soon as Bob accepts the request its LocalConnectionDescription object and its LocalICECandidates are created and added to Connection object, which is reported back to Alice.

Alice receives update from Bob, adding the new objects sent by Bob as its RemoteConnectionDescription and RemoteICECandidates. Alice is set as observer of these new objects.

### ICE Candidates exchanged

<!--
@startuml "comm-setup-activity-2.png"

    |Alice|
partition ICECandidatesExchanged {


    :ICECandidate added to Alice's LocalICECandidates is reported;
    }

    |Bob|

partition ICECandidatesExchanged {
    :ICECandidate added to Bob's RemoteICECandidates is observed;

    }



@enduml
-->

Alice adds a ICE Candidate to its LocalICECandidates Object and reports to Bob.

Bob observes there is a new ICE Candidate in its RemoteICECandidates object.

    |Alice|

partition ICECandidatesExchanged {
    :ICECandidate added to Alice's RemoteICECandidates is observed;
    }

Bob adds a ICE Candidate to its LocalICECandidates Object and reports to Alice.

Alice observes there is a new ICE Candidate in its RemoteICECandidates object.

### Connection is established

    |Alice|
partition StreamAddedAtAliceConnection {
    :Stream added to Alice's LocalIceCandidates\nand status set to connected is reported;
    }

    |Bob|

partition StreamAddedAtAliceReceiver {
    :Stream added to Bob's RemoteIceCandidates\nand status set to connected is observed;

    }


@enduml
-->

Alice reports a remote stream is added in its LocalIceCandidates object and its status is set to connected

Bob observes that its source stream was added in its RemoteIceCandidates object and its status was set to connected

Bob reports a remote stream is added in its LocalIceCandidates object and its status is set to connected

Alice observes that its source stream was added in its RemoteIceCandidates object and its status was set to connected

Alice reports Connection status is set to Connected

Bob observes Connection status was set to Connected
